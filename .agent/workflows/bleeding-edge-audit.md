# Bleeding-Edge Component Audit

Holistic modernization with the latest patterns from Tailwind, Shadcn, and UX best practices.
**Bias towards highest effort / maximum polish** — this is about bleeding edge, not shipping fast.

> **📁 Project Context:** Reference `.agent/project-context.json` for stack info.
> Run `/detect-stack` if missing or outdated.

## 0. Understand Context First (CRITICAL)

Before touching code, answer:
1. **What is this component trying to accomplish?**
2. **Who uses it?** (admin, customer, developer)
3. **What's the ideal emotional response?** (trust, speed, delight, clarity)
4. **Where does this fit in the user journey?**

**Example contexts:**
- Admin panel → prioritize **clarity, density, efficiency** (Inter, Geist, mono for data)
- Customer-facing → prioritize **warmth, brand, delight** (softer fonts, more whitespace)
- Data dashboard → prioritize **scannability, hierarchy** (tabular nums, tight spacing)

---

## 0.5 Semantic Hierarchy Check (DON'T SKIP)

**Ask: Does the visual hierarchy match what the USER actually cares about?**

For each piece of data displayed, ask:
1. **What does this represent from the user's perspective?** (not the database's)
2. **Is this the primary identifier?** (what would the user SAY they ordered?)
3. **Is metadata being shown as primary content?** (container type vs actual product)
4. **Are raw field names user-friendly?** ("Original Prompt" → "Customer's Inspiration")

**Red flags:**
- Technical/database field names visible to users
- Container/wrapper/variant shown as title instead of content
- Important info buried in a nested card when it should be the headline
- Labels that require domain knowledge to understand

**Example fix we learned:**
| Data field | Database says | User thinks | Display as |
|------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Product | "Metal Tin 8oz" | "My candle" | Subtitle/meta |
| Custom Name | "Literary Blueberry Bliss" | "What I ordered" | **Primary title** |

## 1. Analyze Current Implementation

- View the target component file(s)
- Note current:
  - **Typography** (font family, sizes, weights, line heights)
  - **Spacing** (padding, margins, gaps)
  - **Colors** (semantic usage, contrast)
  - **Hierarchy** (visual weight, what draws eye first)
  - **Animations** (current vs possible)
  - **Mobile responsiveness**

---

## 2. Research Bleeding-Edge Patterns

### Typography & Fonts
```
Use context7 with: /websites/tailwindcss
Topics:
- "font-family font-sans font-mono"
- "text-size tracking leading"
- "tabular-nums font-feature"

Web search:
- "best font for admin panel {CURRENT_YEAR}"
- "modern dashboard typography tailwind"
```

### Spacing & Layout
```
Use context7 with: /websites/tailwindcss
Topics:
- "gap space-y space-x"
- "container queries @container"
- "grid auto-fit minmax"
```

### Shadcn Components
```
Use context7 with: /websites/ui_shadcn
Topics:
- "[component] responsive layout"
- "card skeleton hover"
- "badge spinner status"
```

### Animations
```
Use context7 with: /rombohq/tailwindcss-motion
Topics:
- "motion-preset-fade"
- "motion-preset-slide"
- "staggered delay"
```

### UX Patterns (Web Search)
> **⚠️ CRITICAL:** The current date is provided in the system metadata as `The current local time is: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`.
> Extract the YEAR and MONTH from there. DO NOT hallucinate a year.

```
Search: "[component type] UX best practices {CURRENT_MONTH} {CURRENT_YEAR}"
Search: "[use case] UI pattern latest {CURRENT_YEAR}"
Search: "information hierarchy [context] modern"
Search: "[component] shadcn tailwind beta canary"
```

---

## 3. Present Proposal (REQUIRED)

**Always present findings in this format before implementing:**

```markdown
## 🔍 Bleeding-Edge Audit: [COMPONENT NAME]

### Context Understanding
- **Purpose:** What this component does
- **User:** Who uses it  
- **Goal:** Desired user feeling/outcome
- **Current State:** Brief assessment

### 📦 Dependencies
- List any new packages

### Recommendations
1. High priority items
2. Medium priority items
3. Optional polish items

---

### 🧠 HITL Check (Human-In-The-Loop)
> **Does my semantic hierarchy interpretation match your domain knowledge?**
> 
> I may have misunderstood what data is "primary" vs "metadata" in your context.
> Please flag if any labels, hierarchy, or terminology seems wrong.

**Which should I implement?**
```

---

## 4. Implement Changes (after approval)

Order of implementation:
1. **Typography first** (fonts, sizes, weights)
2. **Spacing second** (padding, gaps, margins)
3. **Colors/hierarchy third** (contrast, visual weight)
4. **Animation last** (motion, transitions)

Always include:
- `motion-reduce:` variants for accessibility
- Responsive breakpoints
- Touch targets on mobile (min 44px)

---

## 5. Verify
- Type-check: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Visual check on desktop AND mobile
- Check reduced motion behavior
- Commit and push

## Typography Reference for Context

| Context | Recommended Fonts | Why |
|---------|------------------|-----|
| Admin Panel | Inter, Geist, SF Pro | Clean, dense, legible |
| Dashboard | Inter + Mono for data | Tabular nums, scannable |
| E-commerce | System UI, Outfit | Warm, approachable |
| Documentation | JetBrains Mono, Fira | Code readability |
